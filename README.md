# Codility
Personal solutions of public Codility exercises (does not infrige Codility norms). Most of the solutions achieved the 100%, but since they are practices, there might be a few with less than 100%. Please, propose new solutions if you like.

The display of these public exercises are based on the Codility Terms: https://app.codility.com/terms-of-service-for-programmers/. These exercises were considered by:
  1. These exercises are NOT involved in formal employee process; they are public free exercises that does not contain any hint or dishonest trick.
  2. These exercise mainly contain my own solutions, so probably they are not fit to be "copy and paste" since they might contain a incomplete solution.
  3.  My intent of this repository is to contain a web-backup of these exercises (to remember the fun).
